Turn your legacy JavaScript application into a React based application.

Hi I'm Julian. I'm a seasoned JavaScript consultant who spedialises in turning legacy JavaScript applications into React based applications.

Does your company own a JavaScript application that is
- increasingly hard to maintain?
- hard to test?
- is based on an outdated or discontinued JavaScript framework?
- has performance problems?
- is based on a hand-rolled framework that only the code-authors can seem to maintain?

Then it's clearly time to refactor your application to use a modern framework like React.

I provide hands-on development, consulting and training as part of my refactoring services. Here's an outline of my approach:
- Incremental code migration so you can keep delivering product.
- Rigorous unit testing strategies to ensure nothing breaks during the refactor.
- Writing automated code migrations.
- Integrating modern development tooling to help keep your codebase small, modular and the developer experience as smooth as possible.
- Train developers to use best practices and work with your team to establish a set of conventions for frontend development within your company.

A little bit about me:

I've worked for tech-startups for the last 4 years all over the globe. Most recently for Rainforest QA as Frontend Development Lead. I'm also an active open source contributor, a speaker and have a background in Art & Design.

Ready to take your JavaScript App to the next level?
