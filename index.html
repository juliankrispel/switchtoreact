  <h1>Hi I'm Julian.</h1>
  <h2>I turn legacy JavaScript code into modern browser-apps powered by <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a>.</h2>
  <h3>Is your JavaScript application...</h3>
  <ul class="ellipsis">
    <li>increasingly hard to maintain?</li>
    <li>hard to test?</li>
    <li>ridden with performance problems?</li>
    <li>based on an outdated or discontinued JavaScript framework?</li>
    <li>based on a hand-rolled framework which makes it impossible to onboard new developers?</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Then it's clearly time to refactor your application.</strong>

  <h3>I provide hands-on development, consulting and training to help you turn your app around.</h3>
  <ul class="checks">
    <li>Incremental code migration so you can keep delivering product without hassle.</li>
    <li>Rigorous unit testing to ensure nothing breaks during the refactor.</li>
    <li>Writing automated code migrations to speed up the refactoring.</li>
    <li>Manual refactoring of JavaScript applications into modular scalable components based on <a href="reactjs.com">react</a> and <a href="redux.js.org">redux</a></li>
    <li>Integrating modern development tooling (like <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a> or <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a>) to help keep your codebase small, modular and the developer experience as smooth as possible.</li>
    <li>Train developers to use best practices and work with your team to establish a set of conventions for frontend development within your company.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>A little bit about me:</h3>
